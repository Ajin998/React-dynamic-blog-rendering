# React Blog Rendering

This project demonstrate how we can render different components in a single page instead of addding anchor tags for linking on different pages.
using react routing concepts.

## Technologies used

1. React Js
2. Git
3. Bash
4. Javascript
5. HTML
6. CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)

## Instruction for starting the application

1. To get started you have to clone this project in your local repository by typing :-
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Ajin998/Blog-render-react.git
   ```
2. After cloning this project into your local repository install all the node dependencies by typing:-

   ```
   $ npm i | npm install
   ```

   </p>

3. After installing all the node dependencies you will notice that a node modules and package-lock.json is automatically created in the root directory of your local repository.

4. After that we are good to go to start our application by typing:-

   ```
   $ npm start

   ```

5. After that you will notice that your application is running at localhost 3000.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
